Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Hospitality Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a virtual hospitality dataset. The objective is to uncover insights, detect patterns, and visualize key metrics using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Pyplot.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to hospitality services, including:

Booking details

Customer demographics

Room preferences

Revenue trends

Seasonal occupancy rates

Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:

pip install pandas matplotlib
