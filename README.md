# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Hospitality Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a virtual hospitality dataset. The objective is to uncover insights, detect patterns, and visualize key metrics using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Pyplot.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to hospitality services, including:

- **Booking details/**
- **Customer demographics/**
- **Room preferences/**
- **Revenue trends/**
- **Seasonal occupancy rates/**

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:

1 **pip install pandas matplotlib**

File Structure
```bash
|-- eda_hospitality_analysis.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for EDA
|-- hospitality_dataset.csv         # Virtual dataset used for analysis
|-- README.md                       # Project documentation
```
2. **Steps Performed**

1. **Data Loading**: Read the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and format inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**:
  - Summary statistics
  - Correlation analysis
  - Customer segmentation
4. **Visualizations:**
    - Booking trends over time
    - Revenue distribution
    - Room occupancy rates
    - Customer demographics insights

## Key Insights

- **Identified seasonal trends affecting bookings and revenue./**
- **Determined customer preferences for room types and pricing./**
- **Analyzed factors influencing cancellations and customer retention./**

## How to Run

Open Jupyter Notebook: 
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Run the ```bash eda_hospitality_analysis.ipynb``` file step by step.

## Conclusion

This EDA provides valuable insights into hospitality trends, customer behavior, and business performance. Further analysis can include predictive modeling for revenue forecasting and customer retention strategies.
